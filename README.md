For this project I decided to put together a suite of games common among school children, often played with pen and paper. I chose to include four games, including hangman; tic tac toe; rock, paper, scissors; and a number guesser. I chose this as my project because I thought a single game would be too simple and I wanted to challenge myself. This challenge came from not only being able to switch between multiple games but also implementing a graphical interface for the user to interact with.

# This Includes:

Hangman

Pick the lenth of word you want and try to guess it! Be careful, though, because you only have six inccorrect guesses before it's Game Over!

Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beat Paper! Play against the computer and see if you can win against a truely random opponent!

Number Guesser

Choose the maximum possible number and the computer will pick a random number! See how many attempts it takes you to guess it!

Sit down with a friend and play one of the most classic two player games! Take turns picking a square and try to be the first to get three in a row!

# How to Play

All you have to do is save every file into the same folder onto your computer and run the .py file. It really is just that simple!!!
